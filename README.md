# Othelo.Ai
This Ai uses alpha beta prunning and smart heuristics to beat other agents in the game of Othelo.
#### Please drop a star if you find this helpful or atleast mildly exciting ;)
###### Note: This project is based on one used in Columbia Universityâ€™s Artificial Intelligence Course (COMS W4701). Special thanks to Dr. Daniel Bauer, who developed the starter code that's further extended.
